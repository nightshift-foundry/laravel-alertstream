A lightweight, extensible Laravel package that captures exceptions and sends rich alerts to **Slack, Teams, Discord, and Mail**, plus any custom destination you build.
No configuration required for exception reporting, queue-friendly, and runs completely off your request hot path.

## Features

- 🚨 **Automatic exception reporting** - no code changes required after install
- 📡 **Built-in channels** - Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Mail (one env var to activate each)
- 🔌 **Fully extensible** - implement one interface and tag it; AlertStream discovers it automatically
- ⚡  **Queue-friendly** - runs async via a queue worker by default, or inline synchronously if preferred
- 📋 **Rich context** - exception class, severity, URL, user ID, IP, user agent, environment
- 📸 **Snapshots** - persist exceptions to the database with a secure, hash-based URL for full stacktrace viewing
- 🛡️ **Throttling** - prevent alert storms by limiting duplicates per minute
- 🔗 **Deduplication** - group identical exceptions into a single snapshot with occurrence count
- 🎯 **Severity mapping** - override auto-detected severity per exception class via config
- 🧩 **Context enrichers** - plug in custom callables to add tenant ID, git SHA, or any data to every alert
- 🔔 **Notification channel** - use AlertStream as a Laravel notification channel alongside mail, SMS, etc.
- 💚 **Health check endpoint** - JSON endpoint to verify AlertStream status from monitoring dashboards
- 🔄 **Webhook retry** - automatic retry with backoff on transient webhook failures

## Installation

```bash
composer require nightshift-foundry/laravel-alertstream
```

Publish the config:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=alertstream-config
```

## Built-in AlertChannels

Activate any channel by adding its name to `ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS` and supplying its credentials. No code changes needed.

```env
# Comma-separated list of channels to activate
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=slack,discord
```

### Slack

```env
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=slack
ALERTSTREAM_SLACK_WEBHOOK=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

### Microsoft Teams

Teams no longer supports direct incoming webhooks the way Slack and Discord do. The reliable approach is a **Power Automate flow** that receives the alert payload and posts it as a formatted chat message.

#### 1. Create the flow

1. Go to [make.powerautomate.com](https://make.powerautomate.com) and create a new **Instant cloud flow**
2. Choose **"When an HTTP request is received"** as the trigger
3. Add a **"Post message in a chat or channel"** action — set **Post as** to `Flow bot`, choose your team and channel
4. Set the **Message** field to the expression:
   ```
   triggerBody()?['message']
   ```
5. Save the flow — the HTTP trigger URL will appear on the trigger step. Copy it.

#### 2. Configure the package

```env
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=teams
ALERTSTREAM_TEAMS_WEBHOOK=https://prod-xx.westeurope.logic.azure.com/workflows/...
```

That's it. AlertStream POSTs an HTML-formatted payload to your flow, which passes the message straight through to the channel. The message includes severity-coded colours, bold exception details, file location, environment, and a **View Full Stacktrace** link when snapshots are enabled.

> **Note:** The HTTP trigger URL contains a SAS token and acts as a secret — treat it like a password and store it in your `.env`, never in source control.

### Discord

```env
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=discord
ALERTSTREAM_DISCORD_WEBHOOK=https://discord.com/api/webhooks/YOUR/WEBHOOK
```

### Mail

```env
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=mail
ALERTSTREAM_MAIL_TO=alerts@your-company.com
ALERTSTREAM_MAIL_FROM=noreply@your-company.com  # optional, falls back to mail.from
```

Multiple channels at once:

```env
ALERTSTREAM_CHANNELS=slack,teams,mail
```

## Custom AlertChannels

Need PagerDuty, Telegram, OpsGenie, or your own internal system? Implement the `AlertChannel` contract and tag it. AlertStream discovers it automatically alongside the built-in ones.

### 1. Implement the contract

```php
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\AlertChannels\Contracts\AlertChannel;
use Throwable;

class PagerDutyChannel implements AlertChannel
{
    public function send(string $title, Throwable $exception, array $context): void
    {
        // deliver your alert via HTTP call, SDK, or whatever you need
    }
}
```

### 2. Register and tag it in any service provider

```php
// App\Providers\AppServiceProvider (or any service provider)
public function register(): void
{
    $this->app->bind(PagerDutyChannel::class);
    $this->app->tag([PagerDutyChannel::class], 'alertstream.channel');
}
```

AlertStream iterates every class tagged `alertstream.channel`, built-in or custom, and calls `send()` on each one. No config keys to add, no arrays to update.

## Automatic Exception Reporting

Once installed, **all application exceptions are captured automatically** with no changes to `app/Exceptions/Handler.php`.

Every alert includes:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Exception class & message | What went wrong |
| File & line | Where it happened |
| Severity | `critical` / `error` / `warning` (auto-detected) |
| URL, method, IP, user agent | Request context |
| User ID & email | If authenticated |
| Environment & hostname | Runtime context |

Toggle reporting:

```env
ALERTSTREAM_REPORT_EXCEPTIONS=true   # default
ALERTSTREAM_REPORT_EXCEPTIONS=false  # disable
```

## Muting Exceptions

Some exceptions are noise: 404s, validation errors, unauthenticated requests. AlertStream ships with sensible defaults already muted, and you can extend the list freely.

### Default muted exceptions

These are ignored out of the box:

| Exception | Reason |
|---|---|
| `AuthenticationException` | User not logged in, expected and not actionable |
| `AuthorizationException` | Access denied, expected and not actionable |
| `ValidationException` | Form/API validation failure, part of normal flow |
| `HttpResponseException` | Manually thrown HTTP responses, intentional |
| `NotFoundHttpException` | 404, common bot traffic and not worth alerting |
| `MethodNotAllowedHttpException` | 405, misconfigured client and not actionable |

### Adding your own muted exceptions

Append to the `mute` array in `config/alertstream.php`:

```php
'mute' => [
    // defaults are listed above, list is fully customisable
    \Illuminate\Auth\AuthenticationException::class,
    \Illuminate\Auth\AuthorizationException::class,
    \Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException::class,
    \Illuminate\Http\Exceptions\HttpResponseException::class,
    \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\NotFoundHttpException::class,
    \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\MethodNotAllowedHttpException::class,

    // your own additions:
    \App\Exceptions\ExpectedBusinessException::class,
],
```

Muting is class-hierarchy aware, so muting a parent class also suppresses all its subclasses.

### Unmuting a default at runtime

If you need to re-enable reporting for a default muted class, call `report()` on the Handler in a service provider:

```php
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\Exceptions\Handler as AlertStreamHandler;

public function boot(): void
{
    $this->app->make(AlertStreamHandler::class)
        ->report(\Illuminate\Auth\AuthenticationException::class);
}
```

## Queue Configuration

### Why queue matters

When an exception is thrown, AlertStream needs to send HTTP requests to Slack, Teams, Discord, etc. These calls can take 100-500 ms each. With the queue enabled, this work is handed off to a background worker instantly and the request returns to the user without waiting. With the queue disabled, all channel calls happen inline, adding their latency directly to the response time.

**Recommendation:** keep the queue enabled in production (`ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=true`, the default). Use `false` only in local dev or when you have no queue worker.

### Queue on (default, recommended for production)

```env
ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=true
```

When the queue is on, **you must have at least one queue worker running**, otherwise alerts will sit in the queue unprocessed. If you don't have a worker, set `ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=false` instead.

```bash
# Minimum required: process the default queue
php artisan queue:work
```

**Preferred: give AlertStream its own named queue.** This isolates alert jobs from your business jobs and lets you tune their worker independently:

```env
ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=true
ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE_NAME=alertstream        # recommended, dedicated queue
ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE_CONNECTION=redis        # optional, falls back to your app default
```

```bash
# Start a worker for the dedicated queue
php artisan queue:work --queue=alertstream

# Or process both your business queue and AlertStream in one worker
php artisan queue:work --queue=default,alertstream
```

If `ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE_NAME` is not set, jobs are pushed to the `default` queue and any existing worker that processes `default` will pick them up automatically with no extra configuration.

### Queue off (sync, for simple setups or local dev)

```env
ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=false
```

All channel calls run synchronously in the same process. No worker needed. Suitable when you have no queue infrastructure, or for local development where you want to see alerts fire immediately without running a worker.

> **Note:** even with `ALERTSTREAM_QUEUE=false`, each channel still fails silently in isolation, so one broken webhook will never crash the application.

## Snapshots (opt-in)

Exception messages in Slack, Teams, Discord, or email are often truncated or hard to read. Snapshots solve this by **persisting every exception to your database** and including a secure, hash-based URL in every channel message. Click through to see the full stacktrace, context, and metadata in a clean web view.

### Enabling snapshots

```env
ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS=true
```

When enabled, AlertStream will:
- **Load its migration** - creates the `alertstream_snapshots` table
- **Register routes** - a `GET /alertstream/snapshots/{hash}` endpoint to view snapshots
- **Register the prune command** - `alertstream:prune-snapshots`
- **Include a "View Full Stacktrace" link** in every channel message automatically

When disabled (the default), none of the above happens. No migrations are loaded, nothing is written to the database, no routes exist.

### Running the migration

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

### Configuration

```env
ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS=true
ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_RETENTION=30                    # days before pruning
ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_ROUTE_PREFIX=alertstream         # URL prefix
```

In `config/alertstream.php` you can also set `route_middleware` to protect the snapshots viewer (default: `['web']`):

```php
'snapshots' => [
    'enabled' => env('ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS', false),
    'table' => env('ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_TABLE', 'alertstream_snapshots'),
    'retention_days' => env('ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_RETENTION', 30),
    'route_prefix' => env('ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_ROUTE_PREFIX', 'alertstream'),
    'route_middleware' => ['web'],          // add 'auth' if you want login-protected access
],
```

### Security

Snapshot URLs use a **64-character SHA-256 hash**, making them unguessable and non-sequential. If you need additional protection, add `'auth'` or a custom middleware to `route_middleware`.

### Pruning old snapshots

Snapshots are automatically eligible for pruning after 30 days (configurable via `ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_RETENTION`), but **you must schedule the pruning command yourself** since Laravel packages cannot register scheduled tasks on behalf of the host application.

> ⚠️ **Required:** add one of the following to your scheduler, otherwise old snapshots will accumulate indefinitely.

**Option 1 - Laravel's built-in model pruning** (recommended if you already use it):

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php or routes/console.php (Laravel 11+)
$schedule->command('model:prune')->daily();
```

The `Snapshot` model uses `MassPrunable`, so Laravel discovers and prunes it automatically alongside any other prunable models in your app.

**Option 2 - Dedicated AlertStream command:**

```php
// app/Console/Kernel.php or routes/console.php (Laravel 11+)
$schedule->command('alertstream:prune-snapshots')->daily();
```

Or run it manually:

```bash
php artisan alertstream:prune-snapshots           # uses configured retention (default: 30 days)
php artisan alertstream:prune-snapshots --days=7   # override
```

### Deleting individual snapshots

Each snapshot page includes a **Delete** button. Clicking it removes the snapshot immediately, which is useful when a snapshot contains sensitive information and you don't want to wait for automatic pruning.

### Customising the snapshot view

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=alertstream-views
```

This publishes the view to `resources/views/vendor/alertstream/snapshots/show.blade.php` where you can customise the layout, styling, and content.

## Manual Usage

AlertStream provides two distinct ways to send messages:

| | `report()` | `log()` |
|---|---|--|
| **Purpose** | Exception alerts that need human attention | Structured diagnostic / operational log messages |
| **Writes to log channels** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Dispatches to Slack, Teams, Discord, Mail** | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Creates snapshots** | ✅ (when enabled) | ✗ |
| **Subject to throttling / dedup** | ✅ | ✗ |
| **Accepts a Throwable** | ✅ (second argument) | ✗ |

### `report()` - exception alerts

Use `report()` when something goes wrong and someone should know about it. The message is written to your configured Laravel log channels **and** dispatched to every active notification channel (Slack, Teams, Discord, Mail, or any custom channel). Snapshots, throttling, and deduplication all apply.

```php
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\Facades\AlertStream;

AlertStream::report('Payment gateway timeout', $exception, ['order_id' => 42]);
```

### `log()` - structured logging at any level

For operational visibility, diagnostics, and auditing, use `log()`. It writes to your configured Laravel log channels **only** and does **not** trigger notifications, create snapshots, or go through throttling.

```php
AlertStream::log(string $level, string $message, mixed $data = null, array $context = []);
```

The `$level` parameter accepts any log level that Laravel supports (the standard PSR-3 levels):

| Level | Typical use |
|---|---|
| `emergency` | System is unusable |
| `critical` | Critical conditions |
| `alert` | Action must be taken immediately |
| `error` | Runtime errors that don't require immediate action |
| `warning` | Exceptional occurrences that are not errors |
| `notice` | Normal but significant events |
| `info` | Interesting events (user login, scheduled job ran) |
| `debug` | Detailed debug information |

Examples:

```php
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\Facades\AlertStream;

AlertStream::log('debug', 'Slow query detected', ['sql' => $query, 'time_ms' => 320]);
AlertStream::log('info', 'User exported report', ['user_id' => $user->id, 'rows' => 1_200]);
AlertStream::log('warning', 'Disk usage above 80%', ['disk' => '/dev/sda1', 'usage' => '82%']);
AlertStream::log('error', 'Redis connection lost, falling back to file cache');
AlertStream::log('critical', 'Queue worker stalled', ['queue' => 'payments', 'pending' => 847]);
AlertStream::log('emergency', 'All database connections exhausted');
```

A `debug()` convenience method is also available as a shorthand:

```php
// These two calls are identical:
AlertStream::debug('Cache miss', ['key' => 'user:42']);
AlertStream::log('debug', 'Cache miss', ['key' => 'user:42']);
```

> **When should I use `report()` vs `log()`?**
> Use `report()` when you have a caught exception and want the team notified via Slack/Teams/Discord/Mail. Use `log()` for everything else. It gives you structured, levelled logging through AlertStream's configured channels without triggering external notifications.

### Dependency injection

```php
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\Services\AlertStreamService;

class OrderService
{
    public function __construct(private AlertStreamService $alertStream) {}

    public function charge(): void
    {
        try {
            // ...
        } catch (Throwable $e) {
            $this->alertStream->report('Charge failed', $e, ['order_id' => $this->id]);
        }
    }
}
```

### Artisan test command

```bash
php artisan alertstream:test                  # test all enabled channels (sends a report)
php artisan alertstream:test slack            # test only the Slack channel
php artisan alertstream:test discord          # test only Discord
php artisan alertstream:test --type=debug     # test debug log path
php artisan alertstream:test --type=info      # test info log path
php artisan alertstream:test --type=warning   # test warning log path
php artisan alertstream:test --type=error     # test error log path
```

The `--type` flag accepts any log level string and defaults to `alert` (which triggers `report()`). Any other value is passed directly to `log()` at that level.

## Throttling

Prevent alert storms when the same exception fires hundreds of times in a short window. Enable throttling to limit how many alerts per exception (same class + file + line) are sent per minute.

```env
ALERTSTREAM_THROTTLE=true
ALERTSTREAM_THROTTLE_MAX=5            # alerts per minute per exception fingerprint
```

When the limit is hit, additional occurrences are silently dropped until the window resets. Snapshots (if enabled) still record every occurrence via dedup, but only the channel notifications are throttled.

## Severity Mapping

AlertStream auto-detects severity based on exception type (`PDOException` -> critical, `HttpResponseException` -> warning, etc.). Override or extend this via `severity_map` in config:

```php
// config/alertstream.php
'severity_map' => [
    \App\Exceptions\PaymentFailedException::class => 'critical',
    \App\Exceptions\RateLimitException::class     => 'warning',
],
```

The map is checked via `instanceof`, so parent classes cover their subclasses.

## Context Enrichers

Add custom data to every alert without modifying AlertStream internals. Each enricher is an invokable class:

```php
// app/AlertStream/AddGitSha.php
class AddGitSha
{
    public function __invoke(array $context, \Throwable $e): array
    {
        $context['git_sha'] = config('app.git_sha');
        return $context;
    }
}
```

Register enrichers in config:

```php
// config/alertstream.php
'context_enrichers' => [
    \App\AlertStream\AddGitSha::class,
    \App\AlertStream\AddTenantId::class,
],
```

Enrichers run in order. If one throws, it is silently skipped and reporting continues with the remaining enrichers.

## Snapshot Deduplication

When a snapshot already exists for the same exception (same class + file + line) within the configured window, AlertStream increments the existing snapshot's occurrence counter instead of creating a duplicate row.

```env
ALERTSTREAM_SNAPSHOTS_DEDUP_MINUTES=60   # default, groups identical exceptions within 1 hour
```

Set to `0` to disable deduplication and create a new row for every exception.

The snapshot index view displays the occurrence count as a badge (e.g. "12x") and the detail view shows "Last seen" alongside the original timestamp.

## Notification Channel

Use AlertStream as a native Laravel notification channel and compose alerts with the same API you already use for mail, SMS, database, etc.

```php
use Illuminate\Notifications\Notification;
use NightshiftFoundry\AlertStream\AlertChannels\AlertStreamNotificationChannel;

class PaymentFailed extends Notification
{
    public function via($notifiable): array
    {
        return [AlertStreamNotificationChannel::class, 'mail'];
    }

    public function toAlertStream($notifiable): array
    {
        return [
            'message'   => 'Payment failed for order #' . $this->order->id,
            'exception' => $this->exception,   // optional
            'context'   => ['amount' => $this->order->total],
        ];
    }
}
```

## Health Check Endpoint

A JSON endpoint is registered at `GET /{route_prefix}/health` to check AlertStream's runtime configuration. Useful for uptime monitors and deployment verification.

```bash
curl https://your-app.com/alertstream/health
```

Response:

```json
{
    "status": "active",
    "channels": ["slack", "discord"],
    "queue": { "enabled": true, "connection": "redis", "name": "alertstream" },
    "snapshots": { "enabled": true, "table": "alertstream_snapshots" },
    "throttle": { "enabled": true, "max_per_minute": 5 },
    "report_exceptions": true,
    "muted_count": 6
}
```
